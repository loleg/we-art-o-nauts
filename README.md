*A [#GLAMhack](https://glam.opendata.ch) project*

The goal of this project is to enhance the appreciation of art through deeper context.

We are using the Virtual/Augmented Reality toolkit from Mozilla called [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/docs/). To work on this project, just download the repository and edit `index.html` in a text editor. There are some resources in the `data` folder.

# Background

During the 2018 Open Cultural Data Hackathon at the Swiss National Museum, we were impressed by a huge tapestry that is currently part of the permanent collection - the [Allianzteppich](https://www.nationalmuseum.ch/sammlung_online/?lauftext=DEP-65&sID=&numOf=30&detailID=177198#177198) (nationalmuseum.ch)

The museum people shared all the data available on the object with us, and we further researched information online to create a timeline of events surrounding its creation and history. In particular, [Der Allianzteppich und die Fragen von Selbstdarstellung, Repr√§sentation und Rezeption](https://www.e-periodica.ch/cntmng?pid=kas-002:2002:53::362) by Sigrid Pallmert was of interest.

Although there is some information on the Wikipedia article [Bildwirkerei](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildwirkerei), we could find very little on the technical term [Wollwirkerei](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spezial:Suche&search=Wollwirkerei) used in the catalog. The question of how to make information about the methods and history of art objects fascinated our team.

We created a spreadsheet using the [Timeline JS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) template, and our code accesses the document published using Google Docs, so that the timeline could be visualized both in the original "2D form" and our 3D edition.
